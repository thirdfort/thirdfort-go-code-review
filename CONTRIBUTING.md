To open a PR in this service as a non-owner:

1) Open the PR and give it a clear title: `[Team name]: [Feature name] [What the PR is about]`
2) Open a new task on the [CONX board](https://thirdfort.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/CONX/boards/55) (title format `PR Review [Team name]: [Feature name] [What the PR is about]`), link it to your PR, and provide all context you can.
4) Link the CONX task to the original story this PR is for (e.g. CONX-123)
5) (Optional) Open a Github issue for the PR.
6) (Optional): Open a thread at either the feature channel or #con-x-team and tell us why it's important to get this done (and by when)
